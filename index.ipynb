    "* Understand and explain use cases for a one-sample z-test\n",
    "* Set up null and alternative hypotheses\n",
    "* Calculate z-statistic using z-tables and CDF functions\n",
    "* Calculate and interpret p-value for significance of results\n",

You observed a sample of 36 customers attempting to rent a car on the website. The mean time to rent was 75 seconds. Is this enough evidence to contradict the company's claim? \n",
